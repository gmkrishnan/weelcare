<h2>Smart Weelchair</h2>

Dear open-source community,

We are requesting your help in developing a smart wheelchair that utilizes autonomous and robotic technology. This advanced mobility solution has the potential to greatly improve the independence and quality of life for individuals with disabilities.

By incorporating sensors, artificial intelligence, and machine learning algorithms, we can create a wheelchair that can navigate its environment and avoid obstacles with ease. Additionally, by integrating robotic arms or other assistive devices, we can help users perform daily tasks and increase their independence.

We welcome contributions from the community in the form of code, design, research, and more. Together, we can create a better future for all. Thank you for your support.

<h2>Assistive Technology for Rehabilitation and Disabilities</h2>


Making a difference in the lives of those with disabilities.Our open-source project aims to develop and improve assistive technology for individuals with disabilities. Create tools and resources that can aid in rehabilitation and improve the quality of life for those with disabilities

<h2>Leveraging Cutting-Edge Technologies
</h2>

welcomes contributions from all, <b>including those that may not involve advanced technology. Even simple changes, such as the addition of a press button, can make a big difference</b>. At the same time, we also recognize the importance of utilizing the latest technology to create innovative solutions for individuals with disabilities

Leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, and the Internet of Things to create innovative solutions for individuals with disabilities. These technologies enable us to develop advanced prosthetics, exoskeletons, and other assistive devices that can adapt to the userâ€™s movements and provide more natural and intuitive control. 

<h2> Join together, we can create a better future for all.

</h2>
Weclome to developers, designers, researchers and anyone who are committed to creating innovative solutions for those in need. We welcome your support & contributions from the community and encourage collaboration to help for better future for PwD
