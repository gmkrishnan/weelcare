<h2>Smart Weelchair</h2>

A smart wheelchair that utilizes autonomous and robotic technology is an advanced mobility solution for individuals with disabilities. These wheelchairs use sensors, artificial intelligence, and machine learning algorithms to navigate their environment and avoid obstacles. They can be controlled through various means such as voice commands, head movements, or even eye tracking, allowing users to move around with ease. Some models also come equipped with robotic arms or other assistive devices to help users perform daily tasks. Overall, a smart wheelchair that incorporates autonomous and robotic technology can greatly improve the independence and quality of life for individuals with mobility impairments.
